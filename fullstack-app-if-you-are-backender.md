backend engineer
I want to...
be able to create frontend part
So that...
I will still move JSONs but now with style
```

In this talk we are going to create a multiplatform app in Kotlin. For this session, you don't need knowledge of frontend frameworks. You will learn what it takes to create a basic interface for your next project.

We'll go through
* Setting up a project with JVM and JS target
* Creating a simple backend for a cat smart feeder
* Creating a basic UI for dispensing food on-demand
