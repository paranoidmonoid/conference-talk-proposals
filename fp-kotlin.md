# Title

Treasure.map(): Functional Programming in Kotlin

# Abstract

What is a monad? Do I need a PhD to write in functional style? Any hidden gems that will improve my developer experience?

In this talk, we'll cover the core concepts of functional programming, discuss typical patterns and structures, their limitations and how to explain to your 
team that a monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors but nobody should be scared.
