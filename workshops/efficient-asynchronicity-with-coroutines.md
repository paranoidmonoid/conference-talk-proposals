# Efficient asynchronicity with coroutines

### Introduction 

Kotlin's approach to working with asynchronous code is using coroutines. The idea behind coroutines is that a function (or a computation) can be suspended and resumed later on. 

Coroutines in Kotlin can also be imagined as a light-weight threads with all the benefits of being non-blocking and good readability compared to callbacks. 

During the workshop you will start from the basics of the asynchronous programming in Kotlin and dive deep gradually into more advanced topics coroutine contexts, shared states and how everything works under the hood. 

### Requirements 

Basic knowledge of Kotlin (Collection API included) is expected from participants. 

### Workshop Content 

- Introduction to asynchronous programming and coroutines 
- Coroutines in depth: contexts, scopes, builders 
- Shared state. Exception handling 
- Streams, Channels, Flows 
- Testing
