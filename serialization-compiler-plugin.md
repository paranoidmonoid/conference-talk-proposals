## Title

Draft titles: 

* Writing compiler plugins with Arrow Meta (too generic?)
* Extending kotlinx.serialization functionality with Arrow Meta

## Abstract

Arrow Meta is a functional companion to Kotlin's compiler. This library opens a way to write compiler plugins, linters and other source transformations. 
Kotlin Serialization is a cross-platform and multi-format framework for data serialization. In this talk, learn how to extend the functionality on Kotlin environment.
We are going to cover the following:

* Setup a multi module project for compiler plugin development with gradle
* Overview of Arrow Meta features
* Use case: Adding a global naming strategy to Kotlin Serialization

The idea of this talk is based on a real story of migrating to kotlinx.serialization and controversy of global naming strategy itself. 
Let's accept the challenge and add more to our favorite language.
